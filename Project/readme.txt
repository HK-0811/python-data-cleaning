## Dataset

- Description: 
This dataset, derived from a Google Forms survey connducted by me, aims to explore and understand the decision-making behavior of investors concerning stocks.
The survey collected responses from participants who provided insights into their investment preferences, risk tolerance, information sources, and factors influencing stock-related decisions.

- Limitation:
As most of the responses were of younger people, a broad perspective of understanding the investor's behaviour wasn't achieved.
